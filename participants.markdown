### [NIH Human BioMolecular Atlas Program](https://hubmapconsortium.org)
Based upon new imaging and biomolecular sequencing technologies, multiple national and international efforts are underway to more comprehensively understand human cells. The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) is a consortium composed of diverse research teams funded by the National Institutes of Health. HuBMAP is committed to developing the next generation of molecular analysis technologies, computational tools, and to generate foundational maps of healthy human tissues in order to accelerate the construction of an atlas of the human body for the understanding the relationship between tissue organization and function. HuBMAP values secure, open sharing, and collaboration with other consortia and the wider research community.
