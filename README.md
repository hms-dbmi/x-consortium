## Local Deployment
Detailed directions can be found at [this page](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).  Once you have `ruby` and `bundler`, simply run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`.  `github-pages` (the `ruby` package backing the usage of Github Pages) needs to be kept up to date with Github's own version, so run `bundle update github-pages` often.
