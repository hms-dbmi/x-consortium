summary: A discussion of meta data use cases with co-chair Milen Nikolov.
---
## Agenda

- Nils Gehlenborg: administrative issues (5 min)
    - Naming of the group: https://forms.gle/7f4WCMfcdt7ZvYxd6
    - Reminder to submit consortium descriptions and links: https://forms.gle/anmLtNoSM1BRcWcX9
- Milen Nikolov: metadata use cases (30 min)
  - Getting a presentation on the [scRNA-seq metadata definition paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14623), and how this metadata definition (and also the associated model-definition process) can extend to defining metadata for a biosample core and other assay types that we can harmonize on would be a fantastic start!
  - We are already using this preprint to guide our scRNA-seq metadata at HTAN and have developed simple tools to consume very similar metadata tables (to the ones outlined in the scRNA-seq pre-print) into Schema.org- and JSONSchemas-encoded data model; we generalized a bit their attributes table so that we can handle other types of metadata (and relationships between attributes).
- All: other business


## Call Notes/Action Items
- Use cases as metadata parameters - useful approach
- Development of use cases was challenging
- Could develop agreed required fields across consortia if high priority queries closely align
- Maggie/Nils: Organize future portal call on CCF data specs (what to document and what data formats)
- All: Continue to vote on name for site/submit consortium descriptions
