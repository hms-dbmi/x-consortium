summary: A discussion of HuBMAP's approach to patient/donor sample tracking with guest speaker Bill Shirey.
---
## Agenda
- Patient/donor sample tracking (Bill Shirey - HuBMAP)
  - Use of tracking software


## Call Notes & Action Items
- Lab creates donor ID and records any internal ID they may be using
- Initial data may not be as curated/complete but HuBMAP leadership has made the decision to accept all preliminary data
- Modeling organs because we begin with whole organ as a start (OPO organ provider organizations)
- Does UUID have any specific length, e.g. after 1000? - never more than 10,000 donors per tissue center
- Local uniqueness with IDs that would not happen if they were lab-based, lab IDs entered so they can be cross-referenced. No ID clashes yet
- No PHI included for Donors

Chuck Borromeo on Neo4J:
- Graph db behind the scenes linking all data in hierarchy, find one sample generated by Bill and show linkage back to TMC generating data
- Backend to store data
- Left to right: TEST TMC, the various TMS (Vanderbilt, Florida, etc.), connected to Registered Donors, to the organ, and from the organ, a small hierarchy of downstream specimens can be created. Metadata is associated with each module

- Similar to HCA model with slight differences, some differences due to not knowing what provenance is needed. HCA metadata has been looked at for sequencing, use and contribute back - issues welcome on GitHub repo, can always set up ad hoc calls

- Everything is visible to centers in web interface, search and find registered samples and see the details, hierarchical representation not there yet but in an upcoming release
- Create and edit capabilities on anything input from your lab
- If someone downloaded a dataset and did their own analysis, someone versioned the data for any reason, anyone who downloaded it will need to get notified
- QA steps? Editing on lab end, review on back end
- Two states of data: staged and published
- Adding new fields is easier, adding new/editing graphs takes a lot of work
