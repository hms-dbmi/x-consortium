## Agenda
- Maggie Vella: Administrative Items (5 min)
- Michael Baudis: SchemaBlocks Presentation (30 min)
- All: Other business

##Call Notes & Action Items
- Group name decided as Cell Atlas Curation Working Group. Nils' team to establish website domain
- Everybody is interested in creating atlases, if we can use the same interoperable standard thatâ€™s the ideal vision, if we can do that lined up with GA4GH it will be easier
- How best to interact, work together: Schemablocks will transcribe phenopackets completely but emphasis is more on blocks, e.g how to represent geographic or population data
- Visit https://Schemablocks.org for more information
