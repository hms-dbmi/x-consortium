summary: A discussion of HCA's ontologies to support cellular resolution data with guest speaker Zina Perova.
---
## Agenda
- Administrative:
  - Welcome to new members, brief update from HuBMAP Annual meeting, clarification of group privacy policy

- Ontologies to support cellular resolution data
  - HCA approach - Zina Perova


## Call Notes & Action Items
- Try and get CCF team on future call
- Ontology lookup service - single POA to latest ontology versions
- Ontology extract service - finds mappings between terms, tools to cross-reference other ontologies (understand even if not used, other groups able to map to ours)
- Monthly ontology release well coordinated with other consortia releases

- Not limited to a single ontology per domain
  - Lots of support for mapping between different ontologies in same domain
- Large number of fields in Uberon, right now manual curation step after the fact, looking for solutions to make that easier
- Milen - CCF in HuBMAP, how could this be plugged into a more standardized ontology? Similar problem for HTAN
- Right now, using organ parts, or if very detailed (e.g. brain, eye), can get much more information, but for less well-defined organs proximal-distal coordinates have been a challenge
- Tools or ontologies that qualify DUAs into a controlled vocabulary that you could use to annotate files so that permissions and sharing can be derived
