- Milen Nikolov: metadata use cases
  - Getting a presentation on the scRNA-seq metadata definition paper, and how this metadata definition (and also the associated model-definition process) can extend to defining metadata for a biosample core and other assay types that we can harmonize on would be a fantastic start!
  - We are already using this preprint to guide our scRNA-seq metadata at HTAN and have developed simple tools to consume very similar metadata tables (to the ones outlined in the scRNA-seq pre-print) into Schema.org- and JSONSchemas-encoded data model; we generalized a bit their attributes table so that we can handle other types of metadata (and relationships between attributes).
